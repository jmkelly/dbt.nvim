## âš¡ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "jmkelly/dbt.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("dbt").setup()
  end,
}
```
---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

You can pass a configuration table to setup() to override the default layout or keymaps, but this is _only_ if you don't want to use the defaults

```lua 
require("dbt").setup({
  width_ratio = 1.0,
  height_ratio = 0.25,
  row_ratio = 0.75,
  col_ratio = 0.0,
  border = "rounded",
  keymaps = {
    enable = true,
    mappings = {
      build = "<leader>db",
      test_nearest = "<leader>dt",
    },
  },
})
```

---

## Disable Keymaps

Don't want plugin-defined keybindings? Just set enable = false:

```lua
require("dbt").setup({
  keymaps = {
    enable = false,
  }
})
```
